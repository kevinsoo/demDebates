# demDebates

This contains transcripts for the 2020 Democratic Debates and code for performing text analysis. I plan to update this as the primary season goes on and more debates take place.

### Debate 1: June 26 and 27

Transcripts downloaded from NBC News (posted [here](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/full-transcript-first-democratic-primary-debate-2019-n1022816) and [here](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/full-transcript-2019-democratic-debate-night-two-sortable-topic-n1023601)). Cleaned using code in `01_cleanData.R`, saved as `demDebate1_2019-06-26_27`.
